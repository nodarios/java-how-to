1. Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once,
the hashCode() method must consistently return the same integer.
2. If two objects are equal according to the equals() method,
then calling the hashCode() method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
3. if two objects are unequal according to the equals() method,
then calling the hashCode() method on each of the two objects may produce distinct or same integer results.
However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
