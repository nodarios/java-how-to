generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods.

benefits of generics:
1. code reuse:
one needs to write a generic method/class/interface only once and use it for any type,
on the other side, generic method/class/interface treat type parameters as object (type erasure).
2. type safety:
generics make errors to appear at compile time rather than at run time
3. elimination of casts
